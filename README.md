## What is Nx Cloud?

[Nx Cloud](https://nx.app) is a great suite of cloud-powered capabilities designed to enhance the development experience for teams using the [Nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx) to manage their monorepo projects.

## Why a Community Edition?

Since Nx Cloud is a proprietary software from Narwhal Technologies Inc., it is hard, almost impossible to actively contribute to it development. This Community Edition aims to open to everyone the possibility to bring new features.

## Features

- **Remote Caching** leverages distributed caching to store and share results of development tasks (e.g., builds, tests, and linting) across the team. This means that once a task is executed by one team member, others can reuse the cached result, drastically reducing the time required for these tasks.
